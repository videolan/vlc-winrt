Subject: [PATCH 11/12] core: avcodec requires 32-bytes memory alignment in
 many cases

For example a IA0L texture on Windows is not 32 bytes aligned and avcodec
complains about it. This will avoid disabling direct rendering in those cases
and reducing memory copies which is even more crucial for high bit depth that
usually come with high definition (4K HEVC 10 bits in this case).

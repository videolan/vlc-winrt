# VLC for Windows 10 Desktop, Mobile and Xbox

This is the official mirror repository of VLC for UWP.

_You can find the official repository [here](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-winrt)._

It's currently written in C# and uses [libvlcpp](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libvlcpp) (C++) and 
[libvlcppcx](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-winrt/tree/master/modules/libvlcppcx) (C++/CX) for interop with managed code.

## Requirements
* A recent enough Windows 10 
* Visual Studio 2017 (UWP workload, C++ workload with VC++ 2017 and C++ runtime for UWP, Windows 10 SDK)
* [Multilingual App Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MultilingualAppToolkit.MultilingualAppToolkit-18308)

## Building

### VLC-WinRT

First, get the code
```cmd
git clone --recursive https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-winrt
```

After this, you need to get a recent nightly build of vlc-winrt: [x86](http://nightlies.videolan.org/build/winrt-i686) or [x64](http://nightlies.videolan.org/build/winrt-x86_64)

Extract the content from the archive to `vlc-winrt/libvlc/Universal/vlc-x86/Debug/` and create the directories as necessary (where `vlc-winrt` is the repositorty root).

If you have downloaded an x64 build, replace the `vlc-x86` folder name by `vlc-amd64`.

If you want to make a release build, replace the `Debug` folder name by `Release`.

### LibVLC

If you want to build libvlc yourself (instead of grabing a nightly build), aside from a lot of time and patience, you need to install and setup `mingw-w64`.
Then run `./compile.sh` with your target platform and configuration.

Use the docker image [here](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/docker-images/blob/master/vlc-winrt-x86_64/Dockerfile)
